## Creating Additional Feeds

A Feed is an HTTP client that implements the `Feed` interface.

```go
type Feed interface {
	ETHUSD(context.Context) (*big.Rat, error)
}
```

The `ETHUSD` method to be implemented is a remote call to a price service. This can be a REST API such as [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api),  but also a smart contract call over JSON-RPC (e.g. [MakerDAO Medianizer](https://developer.makerdao.com/feeds/) )

After you create a `Feed` implementation for the API of your choice, add the feed to the switch statement in the `startFeed()` function in `main.go`. If the API requires an API key you should also add a flag for that. 

Feel free to submit a PR for additional feeds !
